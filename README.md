# eth-kzg-ceremony-alt

Alternative (non-official) implementation in Go of the *contributor* for the Ethereum KZG Trusted Setup Ceremony.

The purpose of this repo is to use it to contribute to the upcoming Ethereum KZG Trusted Setup Ceremony, without using the official implementation.

This implementation has been done without checking the other impls code (nor the python reference neither the rust impl), in order to not be biased by that code.

> This code has not been audited, use it at your own risk.

Why in Go? Ideally would have done this code using Rust & arkworks, but the official impl already uses that.
